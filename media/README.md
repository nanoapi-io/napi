### Mission

NanoAPI is a tool that helps developers refactor their codebase into smaller, more manageable pieces at build time. It is designed to help developers quickly refactor large/monolith codebases into smaller, more manageable pieces at build time. It increases robustness by reducing downtime through isolating. It helps developers better understand what their codebase is doing today. It creates a new development paradigm (develop monolith, deploy microservice) for projects moving fast. We aim to drag developers kicking and screaming into more energy efficient software.
