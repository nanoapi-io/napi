# Shadcn UI Components

These components are imported from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and
should not be modified directly.

## Usage

These components are part of our design system and follow the shadcn/ui
implementation pattern. They are carefully styled and configured to work with
our application's theme.

## Important Notes

- Do not modify these component files directly
- If customization is needed, extend the components in a separate file
- Updates to these components should be done by updating the shadcn/ui packages
  and re-importing

For more information on how to use or customize these components, refer to the
[shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).
