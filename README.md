## Features

- **üîç Inspect**: Analyze your codebase to identify API endpoints, middleware, and other API-specific components.
- **üìù Refactor**: Split your monolith into microservices using the UI and annotations in the code.
- **üèóÔ∏è Build**: Generate modular microservices ready for deployment.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Integrate**: Use CLI commands compatible with all CI/CD workflows for automation.

## Why `napi`?

- Simplifies the process of breaking down monoliths into microservices.
- Improves understanding, maintainability, and robustness at both the architecture and code level.
- Reduces dependency on consultants or contractors for complex refactoring tasks.
- Accelerates development with a "develop monolith, deploy microservice" approach.

## FAQs

If you have questions that aren't covered here, feel free to email us at info@nanoapi.io.

#### Does NanoAPI edit my code?

NanoAPI does not modify your original code directly. Instead, it uses annotations to identify API endpoints, then generates new, isolated microservices based on these annotations. Your existing code remains untouched.

NanoAPI copies and restructures relevant parts of the codebase during the splitting process, ensuring that the refactored output exists alongside the original monolith.

If you're curious, take a look at our source code to explore how it works.

## Installation and Quick Start

Ensure you have Node.js (>=18) and npm installed.

https://nodejs.org/en

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @nanoapi.io/napi
```

### Getting Started

```bash
napi init
```

This will initialize the `.napirc` configuration file, which is essential for managing your project‚Äôs paths and settings. All future CLI commands, including code splitting and UI configuration, rely on this file.

NanoAPI relies on **annotations** to split your codebase. Annotations mark API endpoints, methods, and groups in your code, guiding how monolithic projects are refactored into microservices.

> **Important:** Before running `napi split`, you need to **annotate your codebase**. If you're not familiar with the process, see [Split with Annotations](#split-with-annotations) for a detailed guide and examples.

```bash
napi split configure
```

This will launch the configuration UI. It allows you to configure and preview how your codebase will be split.

```bash
napi split
```

This command allow you to split your codebase. You can use this in your CI pipeline if needed.

## CLI Usage

`napi` provides a streamlined Command-Line Interface (CLI) to interact with and refactor your software projects quickly and efficiently.

For a full list of commands, run:

```bash
napi --help
```

## Core CLI Commands

### Initialize Project

Initialize the project and generate the .napirc configuration file. This step is required before running any other command.

```bash
napi init
```

This will create a .napirc configuration file in the project root, storing paths and settings necessary for further commands.

### Launch UI for Split Configuration

Open the NanoAPI UI in your default browser to configure and organize API endpoints visually. This interactive interface allows you to manage groups, refactor, and preview microservices before the split.

```bash
napi split configure
```

The UI relies on the .napirc configuration file.

### Split Codebase

Split the codebase into smaller, more manageable pieces based on annotations. This is ideal for simplifying large monolithic projects.

> **Important:** This process relies on annotation (see [Split with Annotations](#split-with-annotations)).

```bash
napi split
```

Note: This command uses the .napirc configuration file.

## Split with Annotations

NanoAPI uses annotations to simplify the process of splitting codebases.

Annotations define the structure of your API by marking endpoints, methods, and groups directly in the code.
You add these annotations on top of blocks of code that are registering or handling endpoints.
These annotations guide how your monolith will be split into microservices.

You can check the examples to see how you should annotate your codebases in the [examples](/examples/).

### Annotation Structure

An annotation takes the form:

```javascript
// @nanoapi path:/random method:GET group:Math
```

### Breakdown of the Annotation:

|                                |                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **@nanoapi**                   | Marks the comment as an annotation.                    |
| **path:<path>**                | Defines the API endpoint path (e.g., /random/:length). |
| **method:<method>** (Optional) | Specifies the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST).           |
| **group:<group>** (Optional)   | Organizes endpoints into services during the split.    |

### How does napi split based on the annotation

NanoAPI intelligently filters and organizes code by retaining relevant groups and discarding unused segments. This ensures that your microservices are lean and contain only necessary dependencies.

The process is as follows:

- Annotations matching the targeted group are kept.
- Annotations from different groups are removed. As well as all their dependents.
- Unused code gets removed.

#### Example

##### Input

```js
// src/api.js

// @nanoapi path:/api/v1/users method:GET group:Users
app.get("/api/v1/users", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Users data");
});

// @nanoapi path:/api/v1/users/<id> method:GET group:Users
app.get("/api/v1/users/<id>", (req, res) => {
  res.send("User data");
});

// @nanoapi path:/api/v1/orders method:POST group:Orders
app.post("/api/v1/orders", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Order created");
});
```

#### ‚û°Ô∏è Resulting output

```js
// napi_dist/0/src.js

/// @nanoapi path:/api/v1/users method:GET group:Users
app.get("/api/v1/users", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Users data");
});

// @nanoapi path:/api/v1/users/<id> method:GET group:Users
app.get("/api/v1/users/<id>", (req, res) => {
  res.send("User data");
});
```

```js
// napi_dist/1/src.js

// @nanoapi path:/api/v1/orders method:POST group:Orders
app.post("/api/v1/orders", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Order created");
});
```

### How to Annotate my codebase

There are three ways to annotate your code:

#### 1. Manual Annotation

Add annotations directly above relevant code blocks.

#### 2. CLI + AI

Automatically generate annotations for large codebases using the CLI with AI support.

```bash
napi split annotate openai --apiKey="sk-**"
```

**Note:** LLMs can make mistakes. We recommend reviewing AI-generated annotations carefully before running `napi split` to avoid unexpected behavior in the resulting microservices.

You can use annotations to specify how to split your code.
Simply add them above blocks of code that is handling or registering an endpoint
Here‚Äôs an example:

```typescript
// src/api.js

// @nanoapi endpoint:/api/v1/users method:GET group:Users
app.get("/api/v1/users", (req, res) => {
  res.send("User data");
});

// @nanoapi endpoint:/api/v1/orders method:POST group:Orders
app.post("/api/v1/orders", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Order created");
});
```

You can view more examples in the [examples](/examples/)

Running `napi split` with the following annotations will generate modular services based on these annotations. You'll have a `Users` service and an `Orders` service, each containing the respective endpoint.

## Using the UI

The UI allows you to organize and preview your microservices visually before finalizing the split through the CLI.

```
napi split configure
```

## CI/CD Integration

`napi` works seamlessly with CI/CD platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, and Jenkins.

## Donations

NanoAPI is a fair-source project. Because of this, we feel it would be unethical to keep any donations to ourselves. Instead, here is how we will handle donations:

- Donations go into a pool
- Money from the pool will be distributed to contributors
- At the end of the year, any remaining money will be donated to a charity of the community's choice

We will post regular updates on how much money is in the pool and how it is being distributed.
