# napi - Next-Level Visual Tooling For API Codebases

`napi` is a versatile tool built by NanoAPI and designed to automatically refactor large microlith codebases into smaller, more manageable microservices. With both a powerful CLI and an intuitive UI, `napi` is compatible with all major CI/CD platforms, allowing seamless integration into your development and deployment pipelines.

## Features

- **🔍 Inspect**: Analyze your codebase to identify API endpoints, middleware, and other API-specific components.
- **📝 Refactor**: Split your monolith into microservices using the UI or annotations in the code.
- **🏗️ Build**: Generate modular microservices ready for deployment.
- **⚙️ Integrate**: Use CLI commands compatible with all CI/CD workflows for automation.

## Why `napi`?

- Simplifies the process of breaking down monoliths into microservices.
- Improves understanding, maintainability, and robustness at both the architecture and code level.
- Reduces dependency on consultants or contractors for complex refactoring tasks.
- Accelerates development with a "develop monolith, deploy microservice" approach.

## Supported Languages and Frameworks

`napi` aims to support all major programming languages and web frameworks. Here is the current status:

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available on our [documentation website](https://nanoapi.io/docs/nanoapi).

## Quick Start

Ensure you have Node.js (>=18) and npm installed.

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @nanoapi.io/napi
```

### Getting Started

```bash
napi init
napi ui
```

This will initialize a new NanoAPI project and open the UI for inspecting and refactoring your codebase.

## CLI Usage

`napi` provides the following commands:

```bash
init                  Initialize the NanoAPI project
ui [entrypoint]       Open the UI to inspect and refactor the codebase
split <entrypoint>    Transform the codebase into microservices
napi <platform> annotate <entrypoint> [--token=<key>] Automatically generate annotations for the codebase via OpenAI
```

For more detailed information about the CLI and what each command does, refer to our [CLI guide](https://nanoapi.io/docs/cli/).

## Refactoring with Annotations

You can use annotations to specify how to split your code. Here’s an example:

```typescript
// src/api.js

// @nanoapi endpoint:/api/v1/users method:GET group:Users
app.get("/api/v1/users", (req, res) => {
  res.send("User data");
});

// @nanoapi endpoint:/api/v1/orders method:POST group:Orders
app.post("/api/v1/orders", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Order created");
});
```

Running `napi split` will generate modular services based on these annotations. You'll have a `Users` service and an `Orders` service, each containing the respective endpoint.

## Using the UI

The UI provides an interactive interface to:

- Group and organize endpoints.
- Preview the generated microservices.
- Export refactored code for deployment.

## CI/CD Integration

`napi` works seamlessly with CI/CD platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, and Jenkins. For setup instructions, refer to our [CLI guide](https://nanoapi.io/docs/cli/).

## Donations

NanoAPI is a fair-source project. Because of this, we feel it would be unethical to keep any donations to ourselves. Instead, here is how we will handle donations:

- Donations go into a pool
- Money from the pool will be distributed to contributors
- At the end of the year, any remaining money will be donated to a charity of the community's choice

We will post regular updates on how much money is in the pool and how it is being distributed.
