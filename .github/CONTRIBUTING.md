## Development Environment 

You will need the following tools to develop NanoAPI:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 18 or higher.

### Environment Set Up

We use the fork-and-pull model for contributions. Hereâ€™s how you can set up your development environment:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork locally:
  
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/napi.git
```

3. Enter the folder:
  
```bash
$ cd napi
```

4. Add the original repository as a remote:
  
```bash
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/nanoapi-io/napi.git
```

5. Install the dependencies:
  
```bash
$ npm install
```

### Running the Project

When running locally, the UI and CLI must be run separately to avoid having to recreate production builds of the UI on each change.

To run the UI:

```bash
$ npm run dev:app
```

To run the CLI:

```bash
$ npm run dev:cli <command>
```

Running the `ui` command from the CLI will spin up a web server on your localhost. You can access the UI by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Note:** In case of port collisions, the UI will automatically switch to the next available port.


### Testing

```bash
$ npm test
```

### Linting

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

### Release Process

We are currently formalizing the release process. For now, the NanoAPI team will handle making regular releases.

### Documentation

We are also building on the documentation process. For now, include any documentation changes in your PRs and we will add them into the main documentation.
